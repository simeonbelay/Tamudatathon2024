# ITERATIVE PROMPT
I want you to solve a daily word puzzle that
finds commonalities between words. There are 16
words, which form 4 groups of 4 words. Each
group has some common theme that links the
words. You must use each of the 16 words, and
use each word only once.
Each group of 4 words are linked together in
some way. The connection between words can be
simple. An example of a simple connection would
be "types of fish": Bass, Flounder, Salmon,
Trout. Categories can also be more complex, and
require abstract or lateral thinking.
An example of this type of connection would be
"things that start with FIRE": Ant, Drill,
Island, Opal...
...Provide the one group you are most sure of
as your final answer. I will enter this into
the puzzle and give you feedback: I will tell
you whether it is correct, incorrect, or nearly
correct (3/4 words).
Then we will continue until the puzzled is
solved, or you lose.
Format your answer as:
GROUP NAME: [WORD, WORD, WORD, WORD]
Some rules:
{CHAIN_OF_THOUGHT_PROMPT}- Give your final
answer in the format described above. Do not
add any additional text to your final answer,
just the group name and the 4 words.
Here are the starting 16 words:
{PUZZLE_WORDS}

# CHAIN OF THOUGHT PROMPT
- First, briefly summarize the rules and
objective of the puzzle (in no more than 50
words)
- Next, come up with a category to which four
of the words belong and briefly explain why you
think they belong to that category:

# CORRECT GUESS PROMPT
The response from the game was: Correct! The
category was {CATEGORY_NAME}. Diffulty: {
CATEGORY_COLOR}
Continue to solve the puzzle.
Format your answer as:
GROUP NAME: [WORD, WORD, WORD, WORD]
Here are the remaining words:
{PUZZLE_WORDS}

# NEARLY CORRECT GUESS PROMPT
The response from the game was: Nearly Correct.
Three of your words are in a group, but one is
not in the same group.
Continue to solve the puzzle. Again, provide
one group you are most certain of. MAKE SURE
YOU DON’T REPEAT ANY OF YOUR PREVIOUS GUESSES.
Format your answer as:
GROUP NAME: [WORD, WORD, WORD, WORD]
Here are the remaining words:
